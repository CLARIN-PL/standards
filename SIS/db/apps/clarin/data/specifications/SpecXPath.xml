    XML document. XPath is developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is ranked as an important element in W3C's 
    XSLT standard.</p><p>However, it should be noted here that XPath is not complete in itself but rather designed to be embedded in a host 
      language. For example, with XPath, XSLT follows the simple tree-structured data model of XML documents and finds 
      the necessary elements and attributes for transformation.</p><p>XPath was designed to be used not only by XSLT, but also by others XML parsing softwares such as XPointer or XQuery.</p><p>The two main tasks of XPath is to locate and retrieve nodes or elements in a XML tree and to perform operations over data. 
        That can be operations over numerical data, for example count, add or round; or operations over strings, for example 
        return the part of a (sub-)string, or return the length of a string etc.</p><p>There are two versions of XPath in use today: XPath 1.0 and XPath 2.0. The XPath 2.0 is designed to be used in 
          XSLT 2.0 and XPath 1.0 in XSLT 1.0.</p><p>The important difference between the two versions is, that XPath 2.0 supports more expressions and types, has new data model, 
            new operators and more functions. </p></info><version id="SpecXPath1.0" status="W3C Recommendation"><titleStmt><respStmt id="m8rvSu"><resp>Editor</resp><name>James Clark</name><name>Steve DeRose</name></respStmt></titleStmt><versionNumber type="major">1.0</versionNumber><date>1999-10-16</date><address type="URL">http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/</address><relation target="SpecXPath2.0" type="isSubsetOf"/></version><version id="SpecXPath2.0" status="W3C Recommendation"><titleStmt><respStmt id="v6ln2C"><resp>Editor</resp><name>Anders Berglund</name><name>Scott Boag</name><name>Don Chamberlin</name><name>Mary F.
