      Archives Intiative (OAI) and it aims at representing the specialized metadata
      for language resources and NLP tools for harvesting.</p><p>The OLAC framework is based on the Dublin Core (DC) Element Set and the OAI
      Protocol for Metadata. It uses all 15 core elements from the simple Dublin Core
      metadata set, the refinements and the encoding schemes of the DCMI Metadata Terms.
      Additionally, it is extended with a few more elements for describing language
      resources with specific relevant conceptual domains such as language, linguistic
      type, subject language or linguistic role. For this reason, the OLAC metadata set
      is more varied and specific compared to the DCMES.</p><p>The OLAC is implemented in XML and can be used for the interchange of metadata
      descriptions among participating archives.</p></info><version id="SpecOlac2008" status="Standard"><titleStmt><respStmt id="b9z3QB"><resp>Editor</resp><name type="org" id="SBOLAC">Open Language Archives Community</name></respStmt></titleStmt><date>2008-05-31</date><address type="URL">http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/metadata-20080531.html</address></version></spec>
