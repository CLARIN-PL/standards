            graphs. An RDQL consists of a graph pattern, expressed as a list of triple patterns. Each triple
            pattern is comprised of named variables and RDF values (URIs and literals). An RDQL query can
            additionally have a set of constraints on the values of those variables, and a list of the variables
            required in the answer set. An RDQL query treats an RDF graph purely as data. If the
            implementation of that graph provides inferencing to appear as "virtual triples‚Äù, then an RDQL will
            include those triples as possible matches in triple patterns. RDQL makes no distinction between
            inferred triples and ground triples. RDQL was first released in Jena 1.2.0. The following systems are
            known to provide RDQL: Jena, RDFStore, Sesame, PHP XML Classes, 3Store, RAP - RDF API for
            PHP. In addition, RDQL is one language used for remote query by the Joseki RDF Server.</p></info><relation target="SpecRDF" type="isApplicationOf"/><version id="SpecRDQL-2004" status="W3C Member Submission"><titleStmt><abbr internal="yes">RDQL2004</abbr><respStmt><resp>Author</resp><name>Andy Seaborne</name></respStmt></titleStmt><date>2004</date><address type="URL">http://www.w3.org/Submission/RDQL/</address></version></spec>
