            development environment. The language of FLORA-2 is a dialect of F-logic (Frame logic)
            with numerous extensions, including meta-programming in the style of HiLog and logical
            updates in the style of Transaction Logic. FLORA-2 was designed with extensibility and
            flexibility in mind, and it provides strong support for modular software design through
            its unique feature of dynamic modules.</p><p>Applications of FLORA-2 include intelligent agents, Semantic Web, ontology management,
            integration of information, and others. Future plans for FLORA-2 include standardization
            of the syntax, which will bring greater compatibility with other F-logic based
            languages, such as OntoBroker, WSML (Web Service Modeling Language), and SWSL-Rules.</p></info><address type="URL">http://flora.sourceforge.net/</address><version id="SpecFlora-2-1.1"><titleStmt><title>Loquat</title><abbr>Flora-2 1.1</abbr><respStmt><resp>Author</resp><name>Michael Kifer</name></respStmt></titleStmt><versionNumber type="minor">1.1</versionNumber><date>2015</date></version><version id="SpecFlora-2-1.0"><titleStmt><title>Cherimoya</title><abbr>Flora-2 1.0</abbr><respStmt><resp>Author</resp><name>Michael Kifer</name></respStmt></titleStmt><versionNumber type="major">1.0</versionNumber><date>2014</date></version></spec>
