            and written language corpora. This metadata set is the results of the ISLE project (International Standard 
            for Language Engineering) and is one of the most detailed and most universal proposals for a set of 
            metadata descriptions for linguistic resources.</p><p>The IMDI has several sets of metadata, for example: Catalogue metadata and Session metadata, which describe different levels of information. 
            The Catalogue metadata set describes more the abstract level of the 
            corpus as such. It helps to range and to find the resources in an archive system. The Catalogue 
            metadata set includes information such as title, authors, publisher, language etc. On the other hand, the Session 
            metadata set describes individual recording of corpus components, for example administrative 
            information, information about circumstances and conditions of the linguistic event, groups of resources, 
            information about the media files, personally identifiable information who was involved in the session, etc. 
            Both of the metadata sets are formalized by the IMDI XML Schema.</p><p> The IMDI metadatas set are particularly suitable for annotating multi‐modal corpora. 
            It is very comprehensive and conceptual, and includes other widely known metadata sets like Dublin Core or OLAC.
