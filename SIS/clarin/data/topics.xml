            <title>Generic Corpus Annotation</title>
        </titleStmt>
        <info type="description">
            <p>Annotated corpus is an important resource in linguistic research and is used in
                diverse ways, for example in word sense disambiguation, dictionary creation,
                lexicographic research, information extraction, and so on. Corpus annotation is
                understood as “the practice of adding interpretative (especially linguistic)
                information to an existing corpus of spoken and/or written language” (Leech (1997):
                Corpus Annotation Schemes). This information can include data of different levels of
                linguistics: pragmatics, syntax, semantics, grammatics etc. In this case, a
                distinction is made between primary data and its annotation data.</p>
            <p>They are two techniques for data annotation: in-line and stand-off annotations. In
                the inline annotation, the primary and annotation data are a unit and are saved in
                one data file. The disadvantages of this technique are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> The original data is manipulated and complicated by further processings</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The annotation structures can be overlapped</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The multiple annotations are arranged hardly</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Recently, the stand-off annotation has been widely used. The concept of the
                annotation is that one or more annotations can be saved separately from the primary
                data and linked to it. The annotation data can be stored in the same file with the
                primary data or separately in another file. The advantages are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The separation of primary data and its annotations makes it possible that the
                    primary data is unchanged and can be used for further processing. With indexing
                    on sign-level and word-level, the annotations reference the primary data
                    directly. For this reason, it is necessary that the primary data stay unchanged,
                    otherwise the indexing could be messed up. Therefore, it is reasonable to define
                    a read-only permission for the primary data file.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple annotation</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>It is relatively easy to amend the primary data with further annotations. For
                    this purpose new files will be created.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Each annotation can be modified separately.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>EXtensible Markup Language (XML) is used for stand-off annotation in the majority of
                cases. The XPointer and XLink expressions are used to link and reference annotation
                data to the original text.</p>
            <p>Other types of corpus annotation are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lemmatization</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Part-of-speech annotation</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntactical annotation</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Semantic annotation</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Discourse annotation</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Pragmatic annotation</li>
            </ul>

            <title>Syntactic Annotation</title>
        </titleStmt>
        <info type="description">
            <p>Syntactic annotation includes across-word analysis and its goal is to describe
                structure of sentences. It shows how the words build phrases and sentences, and
                their relationship with each other in a sentence.</p>
            <p>Sometimes a syntactically annotated corpus is called a treebank, because it is
                represented in a tree structure.</p>
            <p> A distinction is made between two basic models: constituency- and dependency-based
                structure annotation. Both structures give the hierarchical structure of the
                sentence. They differ from each other in the way that the elements hierarchically
                relate to each other in one sentence. In the constituent structure, the words build
                a syntactic unit such as noun phrase and verb phrase. The phrases are hierarchically
                arranged and may be deeply nested.</p>
            <p>However, the dependence structure is based on the dependency between the words in one
                sentence and it describes how words relate to other words. In a dependence
                structure, one word is a head and others are its dependents. Usually the tensed verb
                is head of structure and the other words are subordinated to it.</p>
            <p>The further distinction is made between partial and full syntactic analysis. The full
                parsing describes a complete parse tree of a sentence. This kind of parsing is
                difficult and time consuming, because it has large grammatical coverage.
                Additionally it is obtained with a very large technical and time effort. The reason
                is that all possible parse trees must be calculated for a given sentence.</p>
            <p>Another alternative analysis is the partial parsing or sometimes called chunking. It
                describes a partial structure of a sentence without building a complete parse tree.
                In contrast to full syntactic analysis, the partial parsing can identify the phrases
                (for example noun-phrase or verb-phrase) or segments in the sentence. It can not
                analyse the phrases itself or assign what kind of relation the phrases have with
                each other within a sentence. However, it achieves higher accuracy than full
                parsing, and it can be carried out quickly and efficiently. Partial parsing might be
                applied as first step in full parsing as well.</p>

            <title>Annotation of Multilingual Data</title>
        </titleStmt>
        <info type="description">
            <p>Multilingual data are identical or similar data in two or more different languages.
                Multilingual data with different levels of annotation have been used in all kinds of
                language-specific or cross-linguistic research and in various natural language
                processing tasks. They can be applied for a huge range of applications such as
                machine translation, speech recognition, information retrieval etc. Some examples of
                multilingual data are multilingual corpora (e.g. Europarl), international
                vocabularies (e.g. Agrovoc) or multilingual datasets (e.g. DBpedia, YAGO),
                multilingual encyclopaedia and ontology (e.g. BabelNet), and multilingual dictionary
                (e.g. OmegaWiki).</p>
            <p>The complexity factors for building multilingual annotated data are the size of the
                data, the number of languages, and the types of annotation. Some problems in
                multilingual annotation are encoding characters, recognizing letters, numerals and
                symbols in the data, linking between different resources refering to the same entity
                in different languages, and filling in any lexical gap. Lexical mismatches or
                overlaps in a target language is also a common problem. </p>

        <info type="description">
            <p>During morpho-syntactic annotation each lexical tokens in the text corpus becomes a
                tag of morpho-syntactic labels such as part of speech and other morphological
                characteristics.</p>
            <p>Identification of part of speech is the basic step not only for morpho-syntactic
                analysis, but also for many other linguistic annotations such as syntactic, semantic
                etc. Thereby, the tokens are tagged (e.g as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) and
                the syntactic function of the word is identified. It determines, which thematic role
                (e.g subject, object, predicate) has a word in the sentence.</p>
            <p>This will be followed by analysis of morphological characteristics and inflectional
                morphology. During this analysis each token is reduced to its basic morphological
                form and its morphological structure (internal structure of words) and grammatical
                forms (such as number, gender, case, person, tense, aspect, mood etc.) are
                allocated.</p>

            <p>Metadata contained the information about other data. This information should allow
                or/and facilitate to discover, retrieve, use and manage relevant resources. To sum
                up, metadata help to organize those resources.</p>
            <p>Metadata describe main information such as title, author, location or when and where
                the resource was created, and a lot of other data.</p>
            <p>The metadata can be created for physical and digital versions of resources as well.
                Metadata for digital objects can be embedded in a digital object or it can be stored
                separately. In this case, metadata should be linked to the objects that are stored
                and managed in a database. That allows to add, search, modify and read metadata
                information much more quickly.</p>
            <p>There are three main types of metadata:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Descriptive metadata contain generic information about a resource, which should
                    help to search, identify and retrieve resource successfully. Typically it
                    includes elements such as title, author, abstract, publisher and keywords,

            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Structural metadata describe information about logical and physical organization
                    of a resource. For example the information on pages, chapter and subchapter in a
                    text document. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Administrative metadata include the technical information about the resource,
                    its creation, quality control, rights, selection criteria for digitization and
                    preservation. The administrative metadata can fall into two following
                    categories: rights management metadata and preservation metadata.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Structural metadata describes information about logical and physical organization of
                a resource, for example, the information on pages, chapter and subchapter in a text

            <p>The most common storing format for Metadata is XML, SGML and HTML. There are many
                different metadata schemes. Some of the most popular metadata schemes are: Dublin
                Core, OLAC, IMDI, TEI(-Header), etc.</p>
            <p>They differ in their variety of usage, design, extensibility, complexity,
                interoperability with other schemes. Choosing one of the metadata schemes or another

                can be combined to express the several meaning. The pragmatic aspect describes
                information such as connotation, implicature, style, etc. The lexical aspect
                describes intern lexical constraints and relations between different linguistic
                units and compounds such as homonymy, synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, hyponymy,

        <info type="description">
            <p>The Thesaurus is the alphabetically or topically structured vocabulary. The terms in
                a thesaurus are grouped together according to similarity of meaning or domain of
                knowledge, and are interconnected by semantic relations such as synonym, antonym,
                hypernym (generalization), hyponym (specification), etc.</p>
            <p>There are thesauri with word definitions, or/and translations, monolingual and
                multilingual. Thesauri are used in many applications including information retrieval
                and natural language processing, for example for identifying the synonyms and other
                semantically similar related terms for indexing online material or for text analysis
                applications.</p>

            <p>A controlled vocabulary is a "list of terms that have been enumerated explicitly.
                This list is controlled by and is available from a controlled vocabulary
                registration authority. All terms in a controlled vocabulary must have an
                unambiguous, non-redundant definition."

            <p>The primary purposes of controlled vocabularies are to organize information, to
                provide terminology to catalog and to improve the effectiveness of information

        <info type="description">
            <p>According to Jurafsky and Martin (1999: 178), the segmentation is the process of
                taking undifferentiated sequence of symbols and segmenting it into meaningful
                linguistic units. As units can be defined the sentences as well as the word or the
                topic. It distinguishes for example between the sentence and word segmentation. The
                task of the sentence segmentation is to find the sentence boundaries in the text.
                Similarly the task of word segmentation is to split the text into word
                boundaries.</p>
            <p>Depending on the language, the task of the segmentation can be more or less
                complicated.</p>

        </titleStmt>
        <info type="description">
            <p>Markup languages are languages that provide an extra information about the text in
                order to facilitate automated processing of it, including editing and formatting for
                displaying or printing.</p>
            <p>A markup language specifies groups of characters for formatting the layout, style,
                structural presentation of the text such as headings, paragraphs, lists etc. These
                special groups of characters are called tags.</p>
            <p>An example of the most widespread and used markup language is HTML, which is used to
                allow documents to be displayed in web browsers.</p>
            <p>The other most popular is XML, which is a metalanguage, but it allows the definition
                of a document markup language and its structure. The advantage of using XML is the
                facility to develop or modify the markup language with a set of rules and tags,
                which suit to individual requirements and needs, for example name, title, address,
                etc.</p>
            <p>XML is used rather for storing structured data, than for formatting information on a
                page.</p>
