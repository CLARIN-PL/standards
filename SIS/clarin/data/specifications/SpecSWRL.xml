        Unary/Binary Datalog RuleML sublanguages of RuleML. SWRL extends the set of OWL axioms to
        include Horn-like rules. An extension of the OWL model-theoretic semantics is also given to provide
        a formal meaning for OWL ontologies including rules written in an abstract syntax. The rules are of
        the form of an implication between an antecedent (body) and consequent (head). The intended
        meaning can be read as: whenever the conditions specified in the antecedent hold, then the
        conditions specified in the consequent must also hold.</p></info><relation target="SpecOWL" type="uses"/><relation target="SpecRuleML" type="uses"/><relation target="SpecR2ML" type="isUsedBy"/><version id="SpecSWRL-2004" status="W3C Member Submission"><titleStmt><abbr internal="yes">SWRL2004</abbr><respStmt><resp>Author</resp><name>Ian Horrocks</name><name>Peter F.
