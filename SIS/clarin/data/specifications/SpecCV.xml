        <p>"This Standard presents guidelines and conventions for the contents,
            display, construction, testing, maintenance, and management of monolingual
            controlled vocabularies. This Standard focuses on controlled vocabularies that are
            used for the representation of content objects in knowledge organization systems
            including lists, synonym rings, taxonomies, and thesauri. This Standard should be
            regarded as a set of recommendations based on preferred techniques and
            procedures. Optional procedures are, however, sometimes described, e.g., for the
            display of terms in a controlled vocabulary. The primary purpose of vocabulary
            control is to achieve consistency in the description of content objects and to facilitate
            retrieval. Vocabulary control is accomplished by three principal methods: defining the
            scope, or meaning, of terms; using the equivalence relationship to link synonymous
            and nearly synonymous terms; and distinguishing among homographs."
