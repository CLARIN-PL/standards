            Sesame. It combines the features of other (query) languages (RQL, RDQL, N-Triples, N3) and adds
            some of its own. Some of SeRQL's most important features are:
            graph transformation, RDF Schema support, XML Schema datatype support, expressive path
            expression syntax, optional path matching. The SeRQL query language supports two querying
            concepts. The first one can be characterized as returning a table of values, or a set of variable-value
            bindings. The second one returns a true RDF graph, which can be a subgraph of the graph being
            queried, or a graph containing information that is derived from it. The first type of queries are called
            "select queries", the second type of queries are called "construct queries".</p></info><relation target="SpecRDF" type="isApplicationOf"/><version id="SpecSeRQL-3.1"><titleStmt><abbr>SeRQL-3.1</abbr><respStmt><resp>Author</resp><name type="org">Aduna</name></respStmt></titleStmt><versionNumber type="minor">3.1</versionNumber><address type="URL">http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/graduate/691/spring14/01/examples/sesame/openrdf-sesame-2.6.10/docs/users/ch09.html</address></version></spec>
