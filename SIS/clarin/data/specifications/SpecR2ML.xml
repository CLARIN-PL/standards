            different systems and tools, enriching of ontologies with rules, connecting of custom rule system
            with R2ML-based tools for vizualization, verbalization, verification and validation. R2ML is
            comprehensive in the sense that it integrates the Object Constraint Language (OCL) - a standard used
            in information systems engineering and software engineering, the Semantic Web Rule Language
            (SWRL)- a proposal to extend the Semantic Web ontology language OWL by adding implication
            axioms, the Rule Markup Language (RuleML) - a proposal based on Datalog/Prolog, and it includes
            four rule categories: derivation rules, production rules, integrity rules and ECA/reaction rules.
            R2ML provides a rich syntax for expressing rules supporting conceptual distinctions between
            different types of terms and different types of atoms, which are not present in standard predicate
            logic.</p></info><address type="URL">http://oxygen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/rewerse-i1/?q=R2ML</address><relation target="SpecSWRL" type="uses"/><relation target="SpecRuleML" type="uses"/><version id="SpecR2ML-2007"><titleStmt><abbr>R2ML 0.5</abbr><respStmt><resp>Author</resp><name>Gerd Wagner</name><name>Adrian Giurca</name></respStmt></titleStmt><date>2007</date></version></spec>
