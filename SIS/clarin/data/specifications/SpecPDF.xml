    <info type="description">
        <p>Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format developed by Adobe Systems for
            representing documents. It has evolved steadily since 1993. The aim was to create a file
            format for electronic documents, that is system- and platform-independent and can
            contain information such as text, graphics, and multimedia elements like sound,
            animations, and movies. At the same time, PDF files remain compact and have the much
            reduced file sizes as other file formats such PostScript and TIFF. </p>
        <p>PDF is an open standard, that is widely used as a format for creating electronic
            documents, as well as for exchanging and archiving data. Since version 1.7, it has been certified by ISO as
            an official ISO standard.</p>
        <p>It is relevant to mention that PDF has a number of subsets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PDF/X ("PDF for Exchange"</li>
            <li>PDF/A ("PDF for Archive")</li>
            <li>PDF/E ("PDF for Engineering")</li>
            <li>PDF/VT ("PDF for exchange of variable data and transactional (VT) printing")</li>
            <li>PDF/UA ("PDF for Universal Accessibility")</li>
            <li>PDF/raster 1.0 (for storing, transporting and exchanging multi-page raster-image
                documents, especially scanned documents)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the context of CLARIN's language data preservation efforts, centres and users are advised to prioritize PDF/A over PDF.</p>
