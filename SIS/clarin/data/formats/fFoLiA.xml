  <info type="description">
    <p>FoLiA, an acronym for Format for Linguistic Annotation, is a data model and file format to represent digitised language 
      resources enriched with linguistic annotation, e.g. linguistically enriched textual documents or transcriptions of speech. 
      The format is intended to provide a standard for the storage and exchange of such language resources, including corpora 
      and to promote interoperability between Natural Language Processing tools that use the format.</p>
