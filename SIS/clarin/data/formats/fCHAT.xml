    <p>CHAT (Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts) is the most common format for
      transcribing, encoding and analysing child language data. It was developed by Brian MacWhinney
      within the CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System) Project. All of the transcripts in
      the CHILDES database are encoded in the CHAT format. </p>
    <p>By using the CHAT format, transcribed data can be annotated with different levels of
      linguistic information such as phonological, morphological or syntactic information. The data
      transcribed and annotated in CHAT, are compatible with some analysis tools, for example CLAN
      provided also by the CHILDES Project. </p>
    <p>Since the CHAT format is widely recognized in childrenâ€™s language research, many
      transcription tools (such as ELAN, EXMARaLDA, Praat, Phon, Transcriber) supports it. These
      tools can also export and import data encoded in various formats as CHAT formatted data.</p>
