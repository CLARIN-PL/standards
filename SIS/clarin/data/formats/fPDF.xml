  <info type="description">
    <p>For the purpose of CLARIN format recommendations, we treat PDF as a format category that is
      divided along two lines: the development line from 1.0 through 1.7 and 2.0 (the latter two
      defined by ISO standards). We attempt to treat all these and future versions as "PDF", on the
      understanding that centres expect relatively recent versions.</p>
    <p>Another line of division concerns the published subsets of PDF, namely: (after 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_PDF&amp;oldid=1008410576">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PDF/X ("PDF for Exchange"</li>
      <li>PDF/A ("PDF for Archive")</li>
      <li>PDF/E ("PDF for Engineering")</li>
      <li>PDF/VT ("PDF for exchange of variable data and transactional (VT) printing")</li>
      <li>PDF/UA ("PDF for Universal Accessibility")</li>
      <li>PDF/raster 1.0 (for storing, transporting and exchanging multi-page raster-image
        documents, especially scanned documents)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Out of these, PDF/A (which itself is another format category) is of special interest to
      CLARIN, because of its suitability for long-term archiving, such as font linking (as opposed
      to font embedding) and encryption.</p>
