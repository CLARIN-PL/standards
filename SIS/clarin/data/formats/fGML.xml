    <p>"KML is an XML notation for expressing geographic annotation and
      visualization within two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional Earth browsers. KML was
      developed for use with Google Earth, which was originally named Keyhole Earth Viewer. It was
      created by Keyhole, Inc, which was acquired by Google in 2004. KML became an international
      standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium in 2008. Google Earth was the first program
      able to view and graphically edit KML files, but other projects such as Marble have added KML
      support." (Wikipedia))</p>
