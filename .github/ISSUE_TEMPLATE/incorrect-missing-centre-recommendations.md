** Reporting as  **
{ centre representative | concerned user }
Please tell us in what capacity you are making the suggestion. If you are a concerned citizen of the Net, we may need to go through the centre before we dare make the recommendation live.

** Centre concerned **
Please name the centre; the friendliest way would be to access the [SIS recommendations](https://clarin.ids-mannheim.de/standards/views/recommended-formats-with-search.xq) and check the centre identifier in the drop-down box. But it that fails, please use the [centre registry](https://centres.clarin.eu/) and tell us the shorthand name (you may want to sort them by the "type" column and start your search among the "B" centres).
